# Call_recorder
Call recorder. Audio will be saved at /SDCard/CallRec </br>
Known issues:</br>
1. When the service started, the ring runs badly.</br>
2. When making an outgoing call it started recording after you pressed dial. NOT AFTER ANSWERED THE PHONE!!</br>
3. No UI.</br>
I'm trying to fix these issues.</br>
